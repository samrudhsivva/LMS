## Scrum

- 2 Week Scrums

## Design Decision

For Backend:
For our Learning Management System, we implemented the backend using Express and Node.js to capitalize on their robustness and efficiency. Express streamlined the setup of servers and routes, essential for managing the diverse interactions of students, faculty, and administrators. Its middleware capabilities facilitated seamless integration of functionalities like authentication and session management. Node.js's non-blocking I/O model was key in ensuring that our application could handle high concurrency, crucial for the extensive user base of an educational platform. Together, these technologies provided a strong foundation for a scalable and maintainable backend system.

For Frontend:
React and Redux :We used React for UI/UX development to enhance ease of use and modularity, creating distinct components for different parts of the application. To manage the global state effectively across these components, especially in a single-page application (SPA) framework, we integrated Redux. This addition proved crucial for efficiently transferring and managing UI states between components, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience throughout our Learning Management System.

For Database:
Mongo DB: We used MongoDB as our database to harness its robust features and flexibility. This direct integration allowed us to tailor database operations specifically for our Learning Management System, optimizing performance and scalability effectively.
